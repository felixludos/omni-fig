Project Structure
=================

There are several ways to run scripts that are registered using ``omni-fig``. The most common way is through the command line using the ``fig`` command or from a different environment (eg. a jupyter notebook) using :func:`run()` or :func:`quick_run()` (depending on if the config has already been loaded or not).
