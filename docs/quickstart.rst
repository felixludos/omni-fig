Top-level functions
-------------------

By default, these functions provide all the basic and most important features of this package. However, they usually delegate all the real heavy-lifting to the "current" project or profile, so for more fine-grain control over exactly how your code gets organized and additional customization, take a look at the full documentation (particularly the sections about profiles and projects).
