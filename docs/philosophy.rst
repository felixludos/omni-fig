Topics
------

- general philosophy: flexible power!
    - the programmer is king -> compilers hinder fast development
        - programmer centric development vs program centric development
    - write lots of small, modular functions/classes
    - register them as scripts/components or modifiers
    - use a hierarchical config system to easily specific arbitrarily complex arguments/parameters
    - at runtime the config object combines the simple modular objects to offer high flexibility and lots of power
- why `import` is not enough
- package vs leaf projects
- profiles and projects
    - related projects
- config object (push, pull, export)
    - aliases and references
- config files (hierarchy/inheritance)
- scripts
    - meta args
    - execution modes
- components (registration and creation)
- modifiers (auto-modifiers, modifications)
    - auto-modifiers - dynamic type declarations, dynamically injecting behavior (mixins by config)
- lightweight alternatives (autocomponents, autoscripts)
